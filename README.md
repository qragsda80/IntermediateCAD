## DesigningTheDeck

### Description

For this assignment I used the the sketch, extrude, hole, and fillet tool to make the deck. I used the split tool and move face tool to angle to head and tail of the deck.

### Reflection

This is the first of four steps in making this skateboard in Onshape. It was tough to figure out how to make the holes countersunk to mae room for the screws, but I read the instructions again and figured it out after watching the GIFs. This assignment was pretty simple, but fun.



## DesigningTheTrucks

### Description

For this assignment, I used the sketch, extrude, and fillet tool make the trucks. The trucks connect the wheels with the board, so it is an important piece in the building of the skateboard.

### Reflection

This is the second of four steps in making this skateboard in Onshape. I had trouble using the "Use tool" to add pieces onto the part. The Bushing was not fitting on the trucks at one point, so I got Callan to help me. This assignment was a lot more complicated than the last one, which can someties make it more fun. I enjoyed doing this assignment.



## WheelsandBearings

### Description`

For this assignment, I used the sketch, extrude, fillet, and revolve tool to make the wheels and bearings. The wheels make the skateboard able to move smoothly on the ground.

### Reflection

This is the third of four steps in making this skateboard in Onshape. I couldn't figure out how to use the revolve tool, so I asked Mr. Helmstetter and he showed me that I had to make a sketch and a line to revolve the sketch around. This assignment did not take very long and I will use this part 4 times in my assembly.



## PuttingItAllTogether-Skateboard-

### Description

For this assignment, I used the fasten mate, revolute mate, and Replicate tool to assembl all of the pieces and parts together to make the skateboard.

### Reflection

This is the fourth of four steps in making the skateboard in Onshape. I did not have a lot of challenges in this assignment because I am used to assemblies by now, but I did sturggle finding and using the right bolt and nuts for the assembly. Making the skateboard was a lot of fun and I can't wait to start the next project in Onshape.

### Reflection

This is the first assignment of three using and making these lego bricks in Onshape. I struggled with the configurations and learning how they work. I remember doing a little bit of configurations last year, but not a lot. This assignment was fun and challenging, but I eventually figured it out with the help of Mr. Dierolf.

### Reflection

This is the second assignment of three using and making these lego bricks in Onshape. This was a really fun and easy assignment because I remember playing with legos when I was a kid. I enjoyed putting the legos together and building the duck. It was challenging trying to snap some of the pieces together. They would sometimes go through eachother, but I figured it out by trying it a again and just playing around with it.
